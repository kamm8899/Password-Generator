## Password Generator 

# The Repository
The Code Repository("Password-Generator) is where we where given existing HTML file, CSS file, and a starter script.js. The task was to write the Password-Generator functionality in the script.js. This included adding new arrays for lowercase, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The implementation included numerous functions, as well as adding logic for randomizing the password generation. 

The Password Generation code taught me many different things, such as debgging JavaScript through the Developer Tools. I also got more comfortable using JavaScript in this program and learned the best usage of the Math.floor and Math.random functions. 

I ran into some troubles with this code in the beginning where my number function was not working, and I needed to do extensive debugging for the functionality to work. I also had a fair amount of issues with my for loop that provides the logic for the randomiziation of the characterArray.
